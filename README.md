# ArunaWeb 5.0

This is another total revised version for the Aruna website. Powered by [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/), [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Preline](https://preline.co/). 

This version is intended to be used with version **2.x.x** of Aruna, so to start a local test instance, you need a running Aruna instance and a running API Gateway to translate the RESTful http calls into native gRPC for the Aruna server.

1. How to start a local Aruna instance is described in the [Getting started instructions of the Aruna main repository](https://github.com/ArunaStorage/aruna?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) which guides you through the individual steps.

2. How to start the Aruna API-Gateway for a local instance is described in the [Configuration parameters section of the API-Gateway repository](https://github.com/ArunaStorage/grpc-gateway?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration-parameters).
