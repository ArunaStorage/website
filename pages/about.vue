      We are a small team of developers from the Justus-Liebig-University in Gie√üen interested in developing advanced
      cloud native infrastructure and applications.

      As one of the major cloud locations for the de.NBI network, we have years of experience in developing and
      operating cloud-native infrastructures. With this expertise, we aim to further develop the fundamental way in
      which research data is managed and stored in the future.

      Aruna Object Storage is a multi-domain project that was first envisioned as the core cloud storage component of
      the Research Data Commons architecture in NFDI4BioDiversity, and later adopted by the FAIR Data Spaces project and
      NFDI4Microbiota. This multi-domain expertise has resulted in a flexible and generalizable approach to the base
      storage layer that can be adapted to any data management solution in any domain.
